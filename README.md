# code challange
This repository contains two coding challenges. The first challenge calculates a student's grade based on their marks, and the second challenge is a speed detector that calculates demerit points for a car's speed.

## 1 Challange: Determining student Grades
### Description
The program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. Based on the marks, it determines the student's grade using the following conditions:

- **grade A**: marks > 79
- **grade B**: marks >= 60 && marks <= 79
- **grade C**: marks >= 49 && marks <= 59
- **grade D**: marks >= 40 && marks <49
- **grade E**: marks < 40

## 2 Challange: Calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car
### Description
 The program calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". For every 5 km/s above 70, it assigns 1 demerit point. If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended".

# Technologies used
