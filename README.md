# code challange
This repository contains two coding challenges. The first challenge calculates a student's grade based on their marks, and the second challenge is a speed detector that calculates demerit points for a car's speed.

## 1 Challange: Determining student Grades
### Description
The program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. Based on the marks, it determines the student's grade using the following conditions:
grade A: Marks > 79
grade B: 60 ≤ Marks ≤ 79
grade C: 49 ≤ Marks ≤ 59
grade D: 40 ≤ Marks ≤ 49
grade E: Marks < 40

## 2 Challange: Calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car
### Description
 The program calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". For every 5 km/s above 70, it assigns 1 demerit point. If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended".
